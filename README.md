# angular2-with dependencies

This tiny repo was made to have all of RC1 items including node_modules in a repo that can be cloned or downloaded as zip.

Eventually this will be a simple clean seed for angular 2

# Quick start

Clone this repo or download the zip and extract
`npm start` and you are ready!

# Notes
This doesn't include router and few other packages but I'm planning to include soon.

Thanks!
